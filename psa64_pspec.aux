Shown here is the fringe-rate transform of foreground contained data for a 30 m east-west baseline. Blue and green are the real and imaginary part, respectively and red is the absolute valeu. Note the maximum and minimum fringerates correspond to the theoretical minimum and maximum for a baseline of this length at 159 MHz. The center panel shows the real (red) and imaginary (green) parts of the fringe rate filter to be applied. Finally, the last panel on the right shows that the fringe rate filtered visibilities. The fringe rate filter is just a weighting applied in fringe rate space and retains foregrounds.}}{5}{}}
