v032 is the final power spectrum
v030 is final power spectrum without omnical 
v031 is final power spectrum withouth fringe rate filtering (acually only nominal fringe rate filtering).

XXX The above 3 (30-32) are old. Have the 10 minute xtalk removal with too much signal loss.




v040 is final power spectrum. Updated with xtalk removal happening in the fringe rate filter. This has the subtracting the average of the kernel bug fixed.

v050 is the final power spectrum with full fringe rate filter (optimal + crosstalk). 

v051 is power spectrum withouth optimal fringe rate filter, but with nominal fringe rate filter and cross talk removal as zeroing fringe rates below .4 milli Hz.

v052 no omnical applied to it. has final pspec filter (optimal + crosstalk). Had to exclude baseline 50_54.

v053 final pspec without the xtalk part of the fringe rate filter.
