All data for the psa64 data set is located in 
    /data4/paper/2012EoR/psa_live 

Data used for lst binning after omnical was applied (in august) in 
    /data4/paper/2012EoR/psa_live/forlstbinning_omnical_2/

    Within this directory have multiple file types: 
        *.uvcRREcACO      - omnical solution applied to the data.
        *.uvcRREcACOc     - corrected to remove bad antennas flagged by omnical. Are 
                            set to zeros in the O files.
        *.uvcRREcACOcP    - make stokes I from the two linear polarizations.
        *.uvcRREcACOcPB   - delay filtered baselines.
        *.uvcRREcACOcPBx  - cross talk removed using averages. Is the simple but horrible                            method that removes signal. Specifically has 10 minute 
                            averages subtracted off.
        *.uvcRREcACOcPBxR - RFI flagged.

        *.uvcRREcACOcPBR  - RFI flagged. Note these files have no cross talk.
        *.uvcRREcACOcPBRA - pull off the power spectrum baselines. That is the separation
                            0,1;1,1;-1,1 baselines. This made lst binning super fast.

LST binned data is also in
    /data4/paper/2012EoR/psa_live/forlstbinning_omnical_2/

    lstbin_{even,odd} : lstbinned data sets from the *.uvcRREcACOcPBxR files binning 
                        every even and odd julian data separately. This has the lossy 
                        cross talk removal in it.
    
    lstbin_{even,odd}_noxtalk : lstbinned data sets of the *.uvcRREcACOcPBRA files. 
                                same even and odd set up.

    lstbin_fg_{even,odd} : lstbinned data sets of the foreground contained data. That is
                           *.uvcRREcACOcP files. Same even and odd.

    lstbinX[0-9] : these are 10 lstbinned data sets of every tenth julian day being 
                   binned together. This is binning of the *.uvcRREcACOcPBxR data set 
                   and therefore has the bad cross talk removal in it.
    
    lstbin_half{1,2} : LST binned dat from either half of the observing season. Not used
                       in any analysis.


Final power spectrum estimate in Ali et.al 2015 is made with lstbin_{even,odd}_xtalk.

What's inside the lstbin* directories you ask?
    lstbin_{even,odd}
        - Has frffix_sep{-1,0,1},1 : has fringe rate filtered data which has a revised 
          version of the fringe rate filter applied. Has the rms beam weighting and not 
          just the singal beam weighting. L suffix.

        - Also has sep{-1,0,1},1 directories which have the same files as the above 
          directories but has the previous optimal fringe rate filter that has just 
          the single beam weighting.
   
        - The files also have a bandpass applied to them derived from Gianni for the mis
          calculated bandpass from before.

    lstbin_{even,odd}_xtalk : 
        - This is LST binned data that was used in the final analysis. has a
          few different directories in it. All files have the bandpass
          correction applied to it. Also, the optimally weighted fringe rate
          filter has the rms beam weighting rather than single beam weigthing


            -sep{i},1 : has data that is used in the final power spectrum. Has a special
                        fringe rate filter applied to it that has a crosstalk removal 
                        (low fringe rates) and an optimal fringe rate filter.  Also has
                        bandpass correction applied.


            -sep{i},1_nofrf : Has no optimal fringe rate filter applied to it. Only has 
                              the old P14 frigne rate filter applied to it with the
                              an xtalk filter removing fringe rates below 1e-4Hz.

            -sep{i},1_only_optimal : Only has the optimal fringe rate  applied to
                                     it (no cross-talk removal).

            -wrong filt has only the wrong filter applied to it (only beamweighting)



Also in /data4/paper/2012EoR/psa_live/forlstbinning/ there is data that does not
have omnical applied to it. This is our old calibration technique. There are
similar directories here that have the lstbinned data in it. 

    - lstbin_{even,odd}_noxtalk is lst binning of data that does not have the
cross talk removed after the delay filter. This is what was used in Ali
et.al2015 for the comparison. This data does have the bandpass applied to them
from Gianni. Also has the two fringe rate filters applied (crosstalk and
optimal). data used was *.uvcRREcACPBRA

    - lstbin_{even,odd} : old data which had lossy cross talk removal applied to
      it (10 min averages subtracted). DOes have the fringe rate filter applied,
      but may not be the rms beam weighted. May just be the single beam weighted.



copy all of the data from these directories to your computer. 
For me I copied all the data to ~/projects/paper/analysis/psa64/
Below is the data used in the Ali et.al 2015 paper.
    -lstbin_{odd,even}_nomni_xtalk : good data that has no omnical applied to it.
                            same data as lstbin_*_noxtalk in forlstbinning abv.
    -lstbin_even_xtalk_removed : has the final spec data. That is it has the
                    data that was optimally fringe rate filtered and has xtalk 
                    removal (applied in fringe rate space).
    -lstbin_even_xtalk_optimal : same as above data except only has the optimal
                    fringe rate filtered applied to it. There is no cross talk 
                    removal here.
    
    -lstbin_even_fg : has foreground contained data.
    
    - lstbin_even_nomni : has the bad cross talk removal. Shouldnt use this data
      for anyhtin..
    
    -lstbin_even_nomni : has bad cross talk removal. Shouldnt use this data for
     anything.
        

data products are located in lstdiff:
    has the script pspec_run_3_spes.sh that runs all three spearation types.
    runs pspec_cov_v002.py and pspec_cov_boot.py
    uses these scripts from capo #0b9b4d3f0b3334404953a014ed654244fa8f66d6.
    Note that it uses pspec_cov_v002.py from zsa/scripts but 
    pspec_cov_boot.py from arp/scripts.
    
    Also note that this version of capo has the frf_conv package as a submodule. 
    This package implements the optimal fringe rate filter and the cross talk. 
    Look at the src (capo/src/frf_conv.py) to switch on and off the cross talk
    kernel and then reinstall. Pretty messy and disorganized module. This needs
    to be upgraded. XXX to do for ZSA.


    aipy version on sherlock : 38f022c7addc7cc5a3502b874c2f2689bade70e4
    
    ON SHREDDER : capo #11219af5dbd2dc257ae04031dfb36055dea4f4ea 
            capo was needed to implement the fringe rate filter on shredder.
            this capo is the global capo (set as capo in zaki's home directory)
            make sure to check the .bashrc file for proper sourcing and putting 
            into paths. in order to run some scripts like pull_antpols.py from
            aipy, they should just run. However, for other scripts like
            xrfi_simply.py etc, run canopy-PAPER. Also, when installing capo be
            in the canopy-PAPER envirnoment. I need to get this fixed up to use
            my own canopy. This is a work around for now. Basically using
            whatever aipy is shipped with canopy-PAPER environment (which should
            be global, so anybody can use it) and when using the pull_antpols.py
            script it uses aipy version
            #38f022c7addc7cc5a3502b874c2f2689bade70e4.



in order to run power spectrum pipeline. Get all of the uv files together for a
single separation : 
    for sep0,1  we run:
    python /Users/sherlock/src/capo/zsa/scripts/pspec_cov_v002.py -C
psa6240_v003 --window=none -c 95_115 --sep=sep0,1 -b 100
    spits out 100 bootstrap files.
    do this for every separation and bootstrap over all files (all 3 types) and
times with 

~/src/capo/arp/scripts/pspec_cov_boot.py ../sep{-1,0,1},1/v0${VERSION}/pspec_boot00*.npz

plotting script to plot the power spectrum is best used from the paper64
directory : psa64_pspec/plots/plot_pk_k3pk.py
